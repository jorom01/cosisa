# COSISA
The COSISA software was developed by Rom√°n-Herrera, J.C. and collaborators from the Department of Geodynamics, Stratigraphy, and Paleontology at the Faculty of Geological Sciences of the Complutense University of Madrid, in collaboration with the University of Alicante.

This program, designed for local use (on-premise), is developed in Python and integrates the ArcGIS core. Its main purpose is to assess the susceptibility of coseismic slope instabilities. The analysis is based on the Newmark displacement model and the logistic tree procedure. COSISA streamlines and optimizes this process by automating the efficient management of georeferenced raster data.
